Project Name: Subdomain Scanner and Vulnerability Analyzer

Project Description: The goal of this project is to build a tool that can scan a website's subdomains and analyze them for potential vulnerabilities. The tool will use Kali Linux tools to scan for vulnerabilities and produce a report of any issues found.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    Kali Linux tools (such as Nmap, Nikto, and Dirb)
    AttackSurfaceMonitoring (https://github.com/superhedgy/AttackSurfaceMapper)
    A list of subdomains to scan

Steps:

    First, import the necessary Python modules. You'll likely need to use subprocess to run the Kali Linux tools.

python

import subprocess

    Define a function to scan a single subdomain using Kali Linux tools. This function will take a subdomain as input and output a dictionary of vulnerabilities found.

python

def scan_subdomain(subdomain):
    vulnerabilities = {}
    # Use Nmap to scan for open ports
    nmap_output = subprocess.check_output(['nmap', '-sS', '-sV', subdomain])
    # Use Nikto to scan for web server vulnerabilities
    nikto_output = subprocess.check_output(['nikto', '-host', subdomain])
    # Use Dirb to scan for directories and files
    dirb_output = subprocess.check_output(['dirb', 'http://' + subdomain])
    # Parse the output of each tool and add any vulnerabilities to the dictionary
    # ...
    return vulnerabilities

    Define a function to scan all subdomains in a list. This function will call the scan_subdomain function for each subdomain and combine the results into a single report.

python

def scan_subdomains(subdomains):
    report = {}
    for subdomain in subdomains:
        vulnerabilities = scan_subdomain(subdomain)
        report[subdomain] = vulnerabilities
    return report

    Load a list of subdomains to scan. This could be a file or a list defined in the code.

python

subdomains = ['example.com', 'www.example.com', 'blog.example.com']

    Call the scan_subdomains function with the list of subdomains and print the results.

python

report = scan_subdomains(subdomains)
print(report)
